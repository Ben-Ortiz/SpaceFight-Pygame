# SpaceFight_Pygame
A personal project where I made a basic 2 player game where spacehips shoot each other written in Python, using the Pygame library.

# What I Learned  
* Python: Became more familiar with classes and constants
* Pygame: How to use rect for collision detection and have 2 players play in 1 screen.
